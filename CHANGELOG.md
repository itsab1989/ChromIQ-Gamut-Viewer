# Changelog

## v1.5.1

### 🐞 Fixed

- **The quieter buttons were nearly invisible in the light appearance.**
  Their fill sits one step away from the window behind them — a contrast of
  1.01 to 1, which is nothing at all — so **Start again with standard
  settings**, **What do these words mean?**, **Where ArgyllCMS is…** and the
  rest read as plain text rather than as buttons. They have an edge now, in
  both appearances. An edge rather than a darker fill, because a darker fill
  would make them look permanently pressed.
- **Appearance and Accent are set as the headings they are.** Each names the
  group of choices underneath it rather than labelling one control beside it,
  so they no longer read as part of the row below.

## v1.5.0

### ✨ What's new

- **ICC version 4 profiles open.** Display P3, Rec. 709, Rec. 2020, ROMM RGB
  and the v4 profiles paper makers hand out could not be compared against
  before — ArgyllCMS declines them, and it was doing all the reading. They are
  now read directly when it turns one down. On every profile both can read,
  the two answers agree to **well under one per cent** (median 0.2%), which is
  what makes the new reader worth believing on the files only it can open.
- **Turn it by itself.** The shape can move on its own, so you can watch it
  from every side without holding the mouse — which is the difference between
  guessing at a dent and seeing it, because depth only really reads when
  something moves. **Left and right** and **up and down** are set separately,
  each with its own way of moving (a limited swing back and forth, or all the
  way round), its own speed and its own distance. Touch the picture and it
  stops at once, then carries on from wherever you left it.
- **Show the box and its grid** can be turned off, leaving the shape floating
  on the page with no walls, numbers or axis names. Much better for a picture
  going into a document, a slide or a forum post.
- **ArgyllCMS is found wherever it is**, including the version-numbered folder
  the official download unpacks into, which was the one place not being looked
  in. **This window** now says whether it was found, and **Where ArgyllCMS
  is…** lets you point at it or open the download page. Nothing nags you about
  it: measurements, gamut files and ICC profiles all open without it, and only
  `.cxf`, `.mxf` and `.txt` need it.

### 🐞 Fixed

- **Setting the lighting yourself moved nothing.** Which side the light comes
  from and how high it hangs were read from the controls and then dropped
  before the surface was drawn. They work now — and the standard lighting is
  the high, slightly-to-one-side key light it was always meant to be, so every
  shape is modelled a little more clearly than before.
- **The surface looked grainy where it is smooth.** A boundary built from the
  faces of the device cube repeats every point along the twelve edges where
  two faces meet — 27% of them on a 1168-patch chart — and two copies of a
  corner cannot share a shading normal, so a crease was drawn along every
  seam. The dents are untouched; only the false creases have gone.
- **A profile in a system folder could not be opened at all** on macOS: the
  copy step asked to carry the file's permissions and flags across, which the
  operating system refuses for its own files. That is the folder holding
  sRGB, Adobe RGB and Display P3, so it was the obvious one to browse to.
- **The wire cage was a dark mass in the light appearance.** Hundreds of thin
  lines at the weight of text add up; on a pale page they shouted down the
  measured shape they are only there to frame, and went nearly solid at the
  rims. The cage is lighter now, while its key in the legend keeps its full
  weight so it can still be seen.
- **Side by side drew the second chart as a grey wireframe.** An outline is
  there so you can see *through* the shape on top to the one behind it. Side
  by side there is nothing behind it, so both are now drawn solid.
- **The names have come out of the drop-down boxes** and sit beside them,
  where they are said once instead of on every line of the open list.

## v1.4.0

### 🐞 Fixed

- **Side by side drew the second chart as a grey wireframe.** An outline is
  there so you can see *through* the shape on top to the one behind it, which
  is what you want when the two are drawn over each other. Side by side each
  chart has a picture to itself with nothing behind it, so the outline was
  only ever a worse drawing of the same gamut. Both are now drawn solid, and
  your solid/outline choice still applies as before when they are overlaid.

### ✨ What's new

- **Two links at the foot of the settings column**: one to the ChromIQ
  website, and one to Ko-fi if you would like to buy a coffee. The
  application is free and stays fully featured either way.

## v1.3.1

### 🐞 Fixed

- **"See-through: 100%" said the opposite of what it did.** At 100% the shape
  is fully solid, so the control is called **How solid it looks**.
- **The settings column fades at its edges** when there is more to scroll to,
  in both light and dark, so a long column no longer looks as though it stops
  where the window does.

## v1.3.0

### ✨ What's new

- **Move the light.** Two more controls under **Set the lighting myself**:
  which side the light comes from, and how high it hangs. Dropping it lower
  throws longer shadows across the surface, which can make a shallow dent
  easier to see.
- **The accent tint is smooth.** It used to snap every colour to one of six
  accent hues, which showed as six flat patches with hard seams. It is a
  continuous sweep now.
- **Show every patch I measured** has its own ⓘ, as does everything in
  **This window**.

### 🐞 Fixed

- Side by side: each shape is centred in **its own half**, and stays centred
  when the window is resized.

## v1.2.0

### ✨ What's new

- **Two rooms, side by side.** Overlaying two shapes shows where one reaches
  past the other; it does not let you judge either on its own, because the
  one in front hides the one behind. Tick **Show them in two rooms, side by
  side** and each gets its own scene.
- **Their cameras stay together** by default, so you are always comparing the
  same face of both. Untick **Keep both rooms pointing the same way** to move
  each on its own.
- **In the accent colours** — a new way to paint the shape, tinting it into
  the accent family while keeping every point's own lightness, so the shape
  still reads as a shape. The same idea, and the same hue bands, as ChromIQ's
  own theme-coloured gamut viewer.
- **Every setting in "This window" now has its ⓘ** as well.

## v1.1.0

### ✨ What's new

- **It looks like ChromIQ now**, because it is meant to sit beside it: the same
  masthead and colour bar, the same palette down to each value, the same Inter
  type, and the same round **ⓘ** beside every setting.
- **Every explanation is behind that ⓘ.** Hover for a one-line answer, click
  for the full text in a window wide enough to read it. An option that is
  hidden takes its ⓘ with it.
- **There is a log**, so a fault that happened once can still be looked at.
  It never leaves your machine and cannot grow past 10 MB.

### 🐞 Fixed

- The window opens **centred**, on the screen it actually appears on, and fits
  a small display — it can go down to 832px wide.
- Scrolling the settings column no longer **changes a setting** under the
  pointer.
- Hovering a combo box, checkbox or slider now outlines it in **your accent
  colour** instead of a grey that looked like nothing had happened.
- The legend key beside each shape is **visible on a dark page**.
- The caption above the picture is a caption, not a banner, and reads the same
  way in every view.
- Slider handles are round; checkbox labels have room; the radio choices under
  Appearance and Accent are no longer nearly touching.

## v1.0.1

### ✨ What's new

- **It can tell you when a newer version is out.** **Check for a newer
  version…** looks at the releases page and says what it finds. It never
  downloads or installs anything by itself — the most it does is show you a
  version number and offer the link.
- **Nothing about you is sent, and it stays off until you ask.** Everything
  else in the window works with no internet connection at all, so the
  unattended **Check when the app starts** option begins switched off. Pressing
  the button is itself the consent for that one request.
- A check you asked for always answers, even to say you are up to date. An
  unattended one speaks up only when there really is something newer.
- If the site cannot be reached, it says so as the ordinary thing it is —
  never as a fault with your copy.

### 📖 Documentation

- The release notes and README said no network was used. That is now stated
  precisely instead: no request is made unless you ask for one.

## v1.0.0

The first release. See the gamut your printer **actually measured** — not the
one its profile claims — and compare it against another paper, a standard
colour space, any ICC profile, or the boundary of what the eye can see.

### ✨ What's new

- **A gamut built from your measurements.** Open the `.ti3` file ArgyllCMS
  writes when you read a printed chart, and see the colours those patches
  enclose, in 3D, painted in their own colours, with the volume in the same
  cubic Lab units ArgyllCMS reports.

- **A shape that follows your printer's real boundary.** A printer's gamut is
  dented, especially in the deep blues. Given the device values alongside the
  measurements — which a `.ti3` already carries — the surface keeps those dents
  instead of throwing a convex hull over them and claiming more colour than you
  have. You can switch between the two and see the difference for yourself.

- **Compare two papers, honestly.** Coverage is shown in **both directions**,
  because it is not symmetric: a glossy paper might hold 96% of what a matte one
  shows while the matte holds only 71% of the glossy. One "similarity" number
  would hide exactly the difference that decides which paper to use.

- **Compare against a standard space.** sRGB, Adobe RGB (1998), Display P3,
  ProPhoto RGB and Rec.2020 are built in and need no files — useful for asking
  whether the images people send you will survive on a given paper.

- **Compare against any ICC profile.** Point it at an `.icc` or `.icm` and its
  gamut is built the same way, so a paper can be checked against the profile a
  client actually sent.

- **Compare against what the eye can see.** The boundary of every colour a
  surface can show under a chosen light, so a gamut can be judged against
  human vision rather than only against another piece of paper.

- **See *where* you lose colour, not just how much.** Tick **Show me what the
  comparison cannot print** and your chart is painted red wherever the colour
  is out of the other one's reach, grey where it is fine. A percentage tells
  you how much you lose; this tells you which colours, so you can decide
  whether it matters for the pictures you actually print.

- **Slice it at one lightness.** Two shapes in 3D hide each other and depth is
  hard to judge on a screen. Cut through them at the lightness you choose and
  they become two flat outlines side by side, where "this paper reaches
  further into the cyans" is a glance rather than a guess.

- **Draw each shape its own way.** Solid, solid with its mesh, or outline only
  — separately for your first chart, your second, and the comparison. An outer
  shape drawn as an outline is the only way to look at your printer sitting
  inside sRGB and still see your printer.

- **A page you can keep or send.** Save the view as one self-contained HTML
  file. The viewer travels inside the page, so it opens in any browser with no
  network, now or in five years.

### Colour science

Measurements are referenced to **D50**, as print measurement is, and every
conversion states its white point. Working spaces defined against D65 are
Bradford-adapted rather than treated as though the whites were the same.
Coverage is measured with a fixed seed, so the same pair of gamuts always gives
the same answer, and reports its own margin of error rather than inviting false
precision.
