# Changelog

## v1.0.1

### ✨ What's new

- **It can tell you when a newer version is out.** **Check for a newer
  version…** looks at the releases page and says what it finds. It never
  downloads or installs anything by itself — the most it does is show you a
  version number and offer the link.
- **Nothing about you is sent, and it stays off until you ask.** Everything
  else in the window works with no internet connection at all, so the
  unattended **Check when the app starts** option begins switched off. Pressing
  the button is itself the consent for that one request.
- A check you asked for always answers, even to say you are up to date. An
  unattended one speaks up only when there really is something newer.
- If the site cannot be reached, it says so as the ordinary thing it is —
  never as a fault with your copy.

### 📖 Documentation

- The release notes and README said no network was used. That is now stated
  precisely instead: no request is made unless you ask for one.

## v1.0.0

The first release. See the gamut your printer **actually measured** — not the
one its profile claims — and compare it against another paper, a standard
colour space, any ICC profile, or the boundary of what the eye can see.

### ✨ What's new

- **A gamut built from your measurements.** Open the `.ti3` file ArgyllCMS
  writes when you read a printed chart, and see the colours those patches
  enclose, in 3D, painted in their own colours, with the volume in the same
  cubic Lab units ArgyllCMS reports.

- **A shape that follows your printer's real boundary.** A printer's gamut is
  dented, especially in the deep blues. Given the device values alongside the
  measurements — which a `.ti3` already carries — the surface keeps those dents
  instead of throwing a convex hull over them and claiming more colour than you
  have. You can switch between the two and see the difference for yourself.

- **Compare two papers, honestly.** Coverage is shown in **both directions**,
  because it is not symmetric: a glossy paper might hold 96% of what a matte one
  shows while the matte holds only 71% of the glossy. One "similarity" number
  would hide exactly the difference that decides which paper to use.

- **Compare against a standard space.** sRGB, Adobe RGB (1998), Display P3,
  ProPhoto RGB and Rec.2020 are built in and need no files — useful for asking
  whether the images people send you will survive on a given paper.

- **Compare against any ICC profile.** Point it at an `.icc` or `.icm` and its
  gamut is built the same way, so a paper can be checked against the profile a
  client actually sent.

- **Compare against what the eye can see.** The boundary of every colour a
  surface can show under a chosen light, so a gamut can be judged against
  human vision rather than only against another piece of paper.

- **See *where* you lose colour, not just how much.** Tick **Show me what the
  comparison cannot print** and your chart is painted red wherever the colour
  is out of the other one's reach, grey where it is fine. A percentage tells
  you how much you lose; this tells you which colours, so you can decide
  whether it matters for the pictures you actually print.

- **Slice it at one lightness.** Two shapes in 3D hide each other and depth is
  hard to judge on a screen. Cut through them at the lightness you choose and
  they become two flat outlines side by side, where "this paper reaches
  further into the cyans" is a glance rather than a guess.

- **Draw each shape its own way.** Solid, solid with its mesh, or outline only
  — separately for your first chart, your second, and the comparison. An outer
  shape drawn as an outline is the only way to look at your printer sitting
  inside sRGB and still see your printer.

- **A page you can keep or send.** Save the view as one self-contained HTML
  file. The viewer travels inside the page, so it opens in any browser with no
  network, now or in five years.

### Colour science

Measurements are referenced to **D50**, as print measurement is, and every
conversion states its white point. Working spaces defined against D65 are
Bradford-adapted rather than treated as though the whites were the same.
Coverage is measured with a fixed seed, so the same pair of gamuts always gives
the same answer, and reports its own margin of error rather than inviting false
precision.
