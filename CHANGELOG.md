# Changelog

## v1.0.0

The first release. See the gamut your printer **actually measured** — not the
one its profile claims — and compare it against another paper, a standard
colour space, any ICC profile, or the boundary of what the eye can see.

### ✨ What's new

- **A gamut built from your measurements.** Open the `.ti3` file ArgyllCMS
  writes when you read a printed chart, and see the colours those patches
  enclose, in 3D, painted in their own colours, with the volume in the same
  cubic Lab units ArgyllCMS reports.

- **A shape that follows your printer's real boundary.** A printer's gamut is
  dented, especially in the deep blues. Given the device values alongside the
  measurements — which a `.ti3` already carries — the surface keeps those dents
  instead of throwing a convex hull over them and claiming more colour than you
  have. You can switch between the two and see the difference for yourself.

- **Compare two papers, honestly.** Coverage is shown in **both directions**,
  because it is not symmetric: a glossy paper might hold 96% of what a matte one
  shows while the matte holds only 71% of the glossy. One "similarity" number
  would hide exactly the difference that decides which paper to use.

- **Compare against a standard space.** sRGB, Adobe RGB (1998), Display P3,
  ProPhoto RGB and Rec.2020 are built in and need no files — useful for asking
  whether the images people send you will survive on a given paper.

- **Compare against any ICC profile.** Point it at an `.icc` or `.icm` and its
  gamut is built the same way, so a paper can be checked against the profile a
  client actually sent.

- **Compare against what the eye can see.** The boundary of every colour a
  surface can show under a chosen light, so a gamut can be judged against
  human vision rather than only against another piece of paper.

- **A page you can keep or send.** Save the view as one self-contained HTML
  file. The viewer travels inside the page, so it opens in any browser with no
  network, now or in five years.

### Colour science

Measurements are referenced to **D50**, as print measurement is, and every
conversion states its white point. Working spaces defined against D65 are
Bradford-adapted rather than treated as though the whites were the same.
Coverage is measured with a fixed seed, so the same pair of gamuts always gives
the same answer, and reports its own margin of error rather than inviting false
precision.
